# The-Peoples-Bank
Helping the Zuzalu community to prototype, deploy and iterate a democratic bank.

# Project-summary
We propose building a software stack that any Zuzalu community can use to democratically vote on how to spend collective funds. 

We will start with governing the Vitalia Community funds from the Zuzalu Q1 round.

We plan to take inspiration from our friends and collaborators at Consider.it (https://consider.it), a visual voting UX that has been used in local governments like Seattle, as well as Liquid US (https://liquid.us), a liquid democracy voting software used by state governments in the U.S.

After building a working version of the software for the Zuzalu community, our plan is to bring in tens or hundreds of thousands of interested new users from our partners around the world, scaling donations and interested participants. 

Our goal is to rapidly kickstart the worldâ€™s first global democratic governance experiment at scale, and collectively learn-by-doing through proposing and then voting on global democracy projects with collective funds to make true impact.
